It should use each of the following components declared under `src/Components` as a separate `.js` file, like `src/Components/TopBar.js`:

## Top Bar

Displays the welcome banner for the donation page.
We've created this one for you.

## Recent Donations

Displays a list of each of the previous donations, including the amounts, names and captions.
It should receive the list of donations as a `donations` prop.

## Progress

It should receive the total money amount as a `total` prop and the goal as a `goal` prop.
Use an `h2` for its heading.

- Displays how much total money has been raised out of the goal
- (Bonus) Display a progress bar that is filled up to the appropriate percentage. It should also display the exact percentage in text (`44.10%`)

## Donation Form

Should include:

- A field for the donor's name to be entered
- A field for the caption
- A [range](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_range.asp) that sets the donation amount
- A "Donate" submit button

> The "Donate" submit button won't do anything -- we haven't taught that yet.
